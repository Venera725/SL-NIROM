# SL-NIROM
Soft local non-intrusive reduced-order modeling (SL-NIROM) allows flexible overlapping of individual NIROMs using fuzzy c-means (FCM) and multinomial logsitic regression (MLR).

This source code is written in Mathlab language, and implements the algorithm of the research paper "Soft local non-intrusive reduced-order modeling based on soft clustering and classification algorithm."

The baseline code of the MLR.m was written with reference to 'Pattern recognition and machine learning toolbox':
